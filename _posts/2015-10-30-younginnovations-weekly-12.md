This is our first week after Dashain where most of our colleagues came back from their hometown. Some individuals still seem to be in a festive mood :) Overall this year's Dashian was bit of a hassle due to shortage of Petrol, Diesel & Liquified Petroleum Gas.

This week we had our Skill Learning Wednesday (SLW) presented by Nirajan Basnet on "Awesome CSS with Bourbon, Neat, Bitters & Refills". He showed interesting examples & demos to our UI/UX Team. He also mentioned about how the implementation of these libraries can increase our performance.

<!--more-->

Starting from brief introduction, all the UI/UX team together installed these libraries in our working system. We followed Nirajan's guidelines to create a small yet exciting project. For detailed information, he suggested to refer [Bourbon's official Website](http://www.bourbon.io).
