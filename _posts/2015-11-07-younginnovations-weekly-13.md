Now that October has passed and the calendar has switched over to November, it’s time to celebrate the second biggest festival, Tihar which is also called the festival of lights and celebrated for five days long.

Tihar, also called Dipawali is the most dazzling festivals for Hindu. The cities and surroundings are cleaned and presence of Marigold flower is seen everywhere! At night every house looks illuminating with lights, ‘diyos’ and candles.

On November 2, series of seminars and training for 150 selected teams in Ncell App Camp 2015 got kicked off  at Soaltee Crowne Plaza.The aim of the first training was to build capacity of the participants for translating their mobile app idea into a sustainable business.

The second day of the training session was held on November 4. The session was a continuation of the first day and later focused at enhancing capacity of the teams for pitching their ideas/ products. The later session helped the teams to hone their skills in presenting their products and winning hearts of the judges in finals and, probably, of potential investors.

And Finally warm welcome to new recruit Ms.Kritika Karmacharya to YoungInnovations family.

May the festival of lights brighten up you and your near and dear ones lives.Happy Tihar!!
