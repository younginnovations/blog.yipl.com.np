August 22, 2015 was a great day for designers and front end developers in our city. Majority of them were enjoying Kathmandu dribbble meetup at the Entrance Cafe, Pulchowk. Kathmandu Dribbble meetup was held for the first time in kathmandu, with an objective to create learning and networking platform for the designers of Nepal. The event had great speakers/presenter, design showcases, networking tables etc. We had 5 speakers to share their experiences in design,branding and marketing. So lets talk about what happened at the Dribbble meetup.

The event started off with Ishu Subedi sharing her experience about how she gradually moved towards web designing. Even though she had a stable career before stepping in web designing, she was not very satisfied with what she did. She wanted to do something that she truly desired – “DESIGNING”. “Following the money, a simple mistake that everyone makes” – Ishu Subedi. Well, this time she didn’t think about the money and chose a career that she truly desired.

Talking about design, Amit Bajracharya, a senior graphic designer shared his knowledge about design theory. The basic concepts about C.R.A.P (Contrast. Repetition. Alignment. Proximity) were thoroughly explained in simplest way. The examples were very useful as well.

Diveej Shah had a very interesting approach as he normally talked about advertising and branding. This session was highly influential, as a lot of us did not know the difference between branding and advertising. Mr. Diveej cleared the confusion with dramatic examples simplifying the basic ideas of branding and advertising. 

Bidhan Rajbhandari,Founder of Makeways, spoke on how constant marketing and personal branding are key skills to landing lucrative projects. This session was full of fun and inspiration.

Ankur Sharma, Co-Founder of Expresiv Studios ended the session with his presenrtation on Human Computer Interaction. His presentation with the word "Nothing" grabbed the audience attention. 

Followed by presentations, panel discussion was amazing with Bidhan Rajbhandari and Ankur Sharma. Audiences had interesting questions and the answers by the panels were too helpful. 

The meetup ended up with networking and some snacks along with beer.

> “It was great to be a part of Dribbble Meetup. There were a lot of people who desirably participated in Dribbble Meetup. I got the chance to meet and interact with local design communities. It's a great platform for learning and creating new networks for the designers. I got the similar chance to learn something new from them. All the speakers gave their presentation in a interesting way. I enjoyed and learned something new from the presentations. It's an incredible event. Hopefully I will be a part of this event in the coming years as well.” - **Punya Ruchal** 

> “Dribbble meetup featured great presentations. I found the presentation on design principles really informative. Kudos to the organizers.” - **Rakeeb Rajbhandari**

> “A lot of people showed up than I expected. It seemed designers were waiting for an event of this kind to happen. Of course, there were similar events such as Graphic Design Meetup happening for the past 2 years. However, this was Dribbble, the Disney Land for designers :) 
>
> The venue was a restaurant named Entrance cafe. As soon as I entered, I was greeted with a goodie bag! The bag had a Dribbble dot grid sketch book, a ball pen, a Bhav yearly planner and a Tee! Its quite unusual to receive this many swags in a local event in Kathmandu. 
>
> The event started a bit late (an hour late if i remember:) ). There was no lag in between sessions though. There were 5 sessions in total by Ishu, Amit, Diveej Shah,  Bidhan and Ankur. 
>
> Ishu shared her experience on how she got into UI/UX. 
>
> Diveej followed with his session on difference between branding and advertising. It was in this session that I won a Dribbble Yo-Yo! (Yay!)
>
> Amit’s session was on the basics of web/ graphic design.
>
> Next came Bidhan who presented on how/ why a designer should market his/ her designs. 
>
> The last session for the day was by Ankur on Human Computer Interaction. 
>
> None of the sessions seemed lengthy or boring. They were all resourceful, fun and interesting. I specially enjoyed sessions by Ankur, Bidhan and the panel discussion that followed after the presentation sessions. Ankur’s witty presentation (or no presentation) on Human Computer Interaction is something that people will remember for a long time :) Bidhan’s session on “Marketing your design” was both fun and inspiring. He showed why one should choose a career that s/he enjoys doing and is actually good at. 
>
> At the end of the event, there was snacks and free beer! I did not drink though :) 
>
> I congratulate and encourage the organisers to continue Dribbble Meetups in the future. There’s only one suggestion - Please put a raised platform for the presentation slides and the speaker so that people at the back can also see what is happening :)”” 
- **Anjan Shrestha** 

> Since its been a first meet up related to designs I was very hopeful to get the knowledge of creative designs, work process and current projects that are affecting us daily and yes i got that. It was awesome there were speakers/presenter, design showcases, networking tables etc. I personally say this meet up was great where people shows and tells their experiences, promotes, discovers, and explore the designs. It was fun ! - **Nirajan Basnet**

> A meet up that was both educational and inspirational for young designers like us. A lot of new things were shared making the event very lively and enjoyable. Knowledge sharing about how people changed their career to finally have a strong platform in this sector, the women empowerment, branding and advertising the products and lot more was highly inspirational. - **Rishav Malla** 

> “The first ever kathmandu dribble meetup was a great experience for me. I was very excited to see such a good number of people. It was a great platform where we could interact with some of the amazing designers and front end developers. The presentations were amazing where i learned many new things related to design that also provided the opportunity for us to build network among them. The entire session was very interesting as we also received official event t-shirt along with meetup kits from dribble and to add up to it, they provided us with some good refreshments. I am eagerly waiting for the next meetup. All in all, it was a wonderful saturday. Thank you dribble.” - **Sweta Shrestha**
