This week we were part of a Partner workshop on [DevelopmentCheck](http://developmentcheck.org/). [DevelopmentCheck](http://developmentcheck.org/) is a user driven and solution oriented online tool for citizen feedback on the transparency, participation and effectiveness of development projects. This tool was developed by YoungInnovations for [IntegrityAction](http://www.integrityaction.org/). We had participants from many countries like Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Palestine, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nepal present in the workshop. The workshop ended with a dinner where all the participants enjoyed some authentic Nepali cuisines. The partners also had a lot of fun dancing to traditional Nepali tunes.

I also participated in a Branding Strategy Development Workshop for Chyangra Pashmina as part of the Pashmina Enhancement & Trade Support(PETS) project. We have been working with [ITC](http://www.intracen.org/) to develop the website for Chyangra Pashmina.
