We recently made our smoke testing library [Hookah](http://bit.ly/1EBJyYL) open source, you can get it as a composer package from [packagist](http://bit.ly/1LiDppx).

Hookah is a small [smoke testing](http://bit.ly/1huFGnR) command line library for any web application. As it is just a sanity check, it checks if the given URL returns back the right response code, and body is not empty.
