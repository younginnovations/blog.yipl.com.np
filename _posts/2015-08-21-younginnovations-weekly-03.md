We recently made our smoke testing library [Hookah](https://github.com/younginnovations/hookah) open source, you can get it as a composer package from [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/yipl/hookah). 

Hookah is a small [smoke testing](http://bit.ly/1huFGnR) command line library for any web application. As it is just a sanity check, it checks if the given URL returns back the right response code, and body is not empty.

This week's Knowledge Sharing Wednesday featured Achyut Devkota, System Engineer, who presented on VoiceInn, a Telephony Application and it's architecture. VoiceInn is an interactive telephony solution with capabilities to take surveys from callers, have noticeboards built in and user support. To know more about VoiceInn you can view Achyut's [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/achyutdev/telephony-application-voiceinn-and-its-architecture).
