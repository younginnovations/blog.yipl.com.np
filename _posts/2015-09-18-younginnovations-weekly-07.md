This has been a great week at YIPL with teej right around the corner. Everybody was excited for the teej party, organized at our very own office by our very own ladies, Radhika, Neha, Kriti and I'm sure others helped as well.

The ladies had prepared games to get all of the people involved and win some prizes. The games where only for the guys at YIPL which is fair since it's the day for the ladies and they get a pardon. I'm sure they had fun watching us guys getting embarassed when we did the ramp walk to show off our formal attire, which was won by Achyut.

There was game 'Balloon on the Air' won by Manoj, 'Pop the Balloon' won by Nirajan and Prawesh, 'Musical Chair' won by Prashant and the last game and most fun, 'kiss your bride' where guys got to wear lipstick and had to kiss posters of popstars blindfolded which Rakeeb won. I'm very sure all of us had a very good time, I know I did.

Also we had our knowledge sharing program on Tuesday which was preponded due to teej on Wednesday, which was a holiday for the ladies. We guys had to work though. Anyways, our Sr. UX developer, Sweta gave a great presentation on 'Quantity Queries'. If you want to go through the presentation slide, here is [the link](http://blog.yipl.com.np/quantityqueries/).
