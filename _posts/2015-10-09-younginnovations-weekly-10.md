October, the month of autumn, has brought changes not only to season but also to Young Innovation's family. This week, we celebrated birthday of our very own CEO, **Bibhusan Bista**. Thank you for the delicious food and once again, Happy Birthday ![Smiley](/images/weekly10/birthdayCake.gif)

Another drastic change that occured in YIPL is not having KSW. But Yeah !! we will be starting SLW (Skill Learning Wednesday) instead. On this very 1st week of SLW, **Prashant Shrestha**, VP, Business and Technology Innovations, spread the skills regarding the git flow and issue flow to the developers engaged in different projects.

Also, our very own co-worker, **Achyut Devkota**, will depart to US from YIPL family for his higher studies. We, YIPL Family, wish him for his bright future. Lets hope that we will be enjoying some american delight soon.

Dashain is just around the corner so Happy Shopping ![Bag](/images/weekly10/shopping-bag.png) . And, do enjoy some of the links below while basking in the sun and probably flying kites as well. Multitasking at its best.
