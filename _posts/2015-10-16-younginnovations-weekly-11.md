The last week before Dashain holidays had few things to offer - chilly mornings and evenings with on-and-off drizzles from heaven making them even colder. We have come up with a new design for our blog to sooth readers' eyes. We concluded our first two-part Skill Learning Week (SLW) this week. 

<!--more-->

We are happy to implement new design for our blog as you might have already seen the difference while reading this weekly. All credit for the new look goes to relentless work of Anjan, Sweta and Nirajan. Anjan provided a new perspective to the blog with his awesome imagination and wonderful cover images for each blog post (well, almost). Sweta with her prowess in front-end made Anjan's imagination come to reality. This is an ongoing process though. Hats off guys! The blog looks awesome.

Prashant continued to provide his knowledge of gitflow and issue flow during the second session of first SLW on Wednesday. He shared how to use trello appropriately to create meaningful cards to record issues and maintain it using different columns. He showed us the relationship between git flow and issue flow for better output in our work. Our decision to start SLW was perfect to learn new topics to improve our work and personality as well. Since we have holidays next week, upcoming SLW will be held when we come back from holidays to work.

At present, the scarcity of petroleum product in our country has affected us badly in our daily life. However, let's make up with what we have and enjoy Dashain with our family and friends. Let the best season of the year bring out best in us. Happy Dashain folks!
